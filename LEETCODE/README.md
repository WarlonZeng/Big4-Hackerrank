# GOALS

* Treat it like Google interviews (not sure if I should be proud of saying this lol):

1. "**Show your work**". Treat it like a math problem back in college, or even high school. If you can transform the problem into a math problem, do it. That's discrete mathematics you learned back in college.
2. Proceed to solve step by step and naive to well-refined. Find the redundancy and "cross it off" like you would in a math problem.
3. math math math
4. We want to see thought processes. Learning in play. 

* 100 leetcode mediums or 4 months training (thanks /r/cscareerquestions for the training schedule).
* A chapter a week on CTCI?
* Actually learn, absorb every word, and not glance through it.
* Treat it like SAT/GRE? The "SAT"/"GRE" for CS students :) eternally living as a student inside.
