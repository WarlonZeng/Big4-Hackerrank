Time to get back into shape!

Goal: 1 medium problem a day, and more on the weekends. Just ordered CTCI paperback copy.
My system side's all covered down to the cloud :) thnxs Kurt and BNYM -- Chandra, Trevor. 

Next step: Move back into C++, Java, Python backend. Delve into mobile iOS swift and React -- hopefully not too different from Angular.
